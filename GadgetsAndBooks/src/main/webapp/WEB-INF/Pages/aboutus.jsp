			<h3><b>Books:</b></h3>
			<p>The term "books" may also refer to a body of works of literature, or a main division of literature (e.g., children's literature) . In library and information science, a book is called a monograph, to distinguish it from serial periodicals such as magazines, journals, or newspapers. In novels and sometimes other types of books (for example, biographies), a book may be divided into several large sections, also called books (Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, and so on). An avid reader or collector of books or a book lover is a bibliophile or colloquially, "bookworm".</p>
